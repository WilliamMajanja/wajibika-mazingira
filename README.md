**Wajibika Mazingira** (Swahili for "Be Responsible for the Environment") is a powerful, serverless web application designed to democratize environmental and social impact assessments in Kenya. It leverages the Google Gemini API to provide communities, activists, and planners with instant, detailed reports, a secure place to store evidence, and an AI-powered assistant for community discussions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

This project is configured to run without a local build step, using CDN-hosted libraries.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
-   A valid **Google Gemini API Key**.

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wajibika-mazingira.git
    cd wajibika-mazingira
    ```
2.  **Set up the API Key:**
    The application is designed to run in an environment where the `process.env.API_KEY` is already available (e.g., Netlify environment variables, Google's Project IDX). **Do not hardcode your key in the source code.**
3.  **Serve the files:**
    You can use a simple static file server to run the project locally.
    ```bash
    # If you have Python 3
    python -m http.server

    # Or use the Live Server extension in VS Code
    ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to the provided local address (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment to Netlify

This application is optimized for a seamless deployment to Netlify.

1.  Push your cloned repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  Connect your GitHub account to Netlify.
3.  Select the repository and configure the build settings.
4.  Add your Gemini API key as an environment variable in the Netlify UI:
    -   **Key**: `API_KEY`
    -   **Value**: `Your-Gemini-API-Key-Here`

The project includes a `netlify.toml` file that correctly configures the site for a single-page application.

```toml
# netlify.toml

[build]
  command = "echo 'No build command required'"
  publish = "."

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```
